Minecraft AltisCraft.fr extension (more than 30 KLOC of Java and more than 85 000 players).

- Code adding a lot of in-game content.
- Research of different algorithms to answer problems in real time in a massive way (275 players connected at the same time).
- Management of scheduled interactions between the game server, a voice server, a web server and the client computers.
- Management of an authentication server.
- Management of a website.
- Adaptations and improvements of external source codes.
- Extensive use of custom 2D and 3D rendering.
- Numerous user interfaces to increase functionality.
- Security against theft (client-side execution, obfuscation and separation of client and server code)

This repository will be step by step completed during a few years.

I won't upload the full code yet because it may somehow disrupt my main project: LemnosLife
